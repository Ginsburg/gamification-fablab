3. Name your file as you want + add ".md" at the end. This extension is specific to markdown.   
We advice you to use our [naming convention](https://github.com/openfab-lab/openfab/blob/891cee5a70a51c7256b687a5971c4697ffca2d10/xx-src/naming-convention.md): "something-like-this".  
In this example, we decide to create a "README" (one of the rare cases in which you should use uppercase) document, it's used to describe your repository, to tell other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project and how they can use it.

Here's a [tutorial](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to master them, but no need to go that far for your first one. One tip for you, if you want to have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.  
4. When it's done, you can click on "Commit new file" green button, at the bottom of what you wrote.

Let's see what's the result for the example:
As you can see, in some cases there are line break (two trailing spaces), in other cases there aren't (no two trailing spaces).
